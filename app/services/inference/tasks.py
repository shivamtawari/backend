"""The Celery tasks that walk a job's work list.

**Why a self-chaining task and not a chord.** The obvious shape -- fan every image out as a
group and join with a callback -- does not survive contact with this deployment. The Celery
workers run with ``--pool=solo`` (the prefork pool does not work on Windows here), so a task
that blocks waiting for its own subtasks deadlocks the single worker that would have to run
them. And there is nothing to gain from the fan-out anyway: every unit ends in the same
AI service on the same GPU, so parallel dispatch would only trade throughput for VRAM
contention.

So each :func:`run_next` handles exactly one unit and then queues itself again. That costs a
broker round-trip per image -- microseconds against a forward pass -- and buys three things:

* **Cancellation lands within one unit.** The status is re-read at the top of every task, so
  a cancel takes effect after the current image rather than at the end of the run.
* **Crash resumption is free.** The cursor is the item table; a worker that dies leaves its
  unfinished items ``pending``.
* **Hierarchy order is structural.** "The next unit" is the lowest-``level`` pending row, so
  no child-level step can start before every root-level unit in the dataset is done -- see
  :mod:`app.services.inference.planning`.

A unit that fails does not fail the run: it is recorded on its item row and the walk goes on,
so one unreadable image cannot cost a user a six-hour job. A run that ends with failures is
``partial``, not ``succeeded``, and the failed items are listed in the UI.
