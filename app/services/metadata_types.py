"""The type system for image-metadata keys.

A key's *type* is what lets the UI offer the right filter (a range for a depth, a
date picker for a collection date, chips for a site) and what lets the tool say
which keys are meaningful to group a quantification by. Without it every key is a
bag of strings and every filter is a chip list.

Design points:

* **The type lives on the key, not the value.** One descriptor row per
  ``(dataset, key)`` — see ``app.database.dataset_metadata_keys``. A per-value
  type would let one image's ``depth`` be a number and another's a sentence,
  which is exactly the state the type is meant to rule out.
* **Values are still stored as text**, with an indexed ``value_num`` sidecar
  filled in for the ordered types (numbers, dates as epoch seconds, booleans as
  0/1). One storage path, one range-query path, and the human-readable form is
  never lost to a lossy round trip.
* **Coercion is validation, not repair.** :func:`coerce` rejects a value the type
  cannot represent rather than guessing; the caller turns that into a 422 naming
  the offending value. The one exception is canonical *spelling* of booleans and
  dates, where there is a single unambiguous answer.

Numbers and dates deliberately are not groupable: every value tends to be
distinct, so grouping a quantification by them would produce one bar per image.
They need binning first, which is not built yet — see :data:`GROUPABLE_TYPES`.
