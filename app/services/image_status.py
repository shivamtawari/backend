"""Where an image stands in the Calibrate -> Annotate -> Review workflow.

An image goes through three phases, and each one is tracked separately with the
same three states: ``not_started``, ``in_progress``, ``finished``. The overall
status of an image is a *function* of the three, not a fourth thing that can drift
away from them: finished when all three are, not started when none of them are, in
progress otherwise.

This replaces a single five-value lifecycle (``not_started`` / ``in_progress`` /
``rejected`` / ``reviewable`` / ``finished``) that conflated the phases. It could
only describe one dimension of progress at a time, so it had to rank states that
are not actually ordered -- a fully reviewed image that nobody ever calibrated
read as ``finished``, and an image calibrated but not yet annotated read as
``not_started``. Three independent axes say both.

Where each phase's answer comes from:

``calibrate``
    How many of the *registered* calibration kinds the image has set, via
    :func:`app.services.calibration.calibrated_counts`. All of them is finished;
    none is not started.
``annotate`` / ``review``
    ``Masks.annotate_status`` / ``Masks.review_status`` -- hybrid properties, so
    the same definition serves both Python objects and SQL filters. An image with
    no mask row at all has neither phase started.

Sending work back (an open rejection) is what resets the two mask phases; the
image's calibration is untouched by it, and instance-level state (unverified /
verified / sent back) is a separate axis that this module does not model.
