"""Running one unit of a plan: one model, one image, written into the dataset.

The pipeline for a unit, in order:

1. **Predict.** One HTTP call to the AI service for the step's task. The service is the only
   thing that touches a GPU; this worker is an HTTP client that writes rows.
2. **Filter to the step's label** (:func:`filter_for_step`). A multiclass model returns every
   class it knows; a step is responsible for exactly one label, so everything else is
   dropped. A class-agnostic model returns unlabelled objects, which are stamped with the
   step's label instead. This is what lets one plan mix "one specialist per label" with "one
   multiclass model bound to three labels" -- both look the same by the time they are merged.
3. **Nest under a parent** (:func:`attach_parents`), for steps below the root level. The
   parent is the already-written instance of the parent label that contains the prediction
   best; predictions that land inside nothing follow the run's `unparented` policy.
4. **Drop duplicates** (NMS). Candidates compete with each other and -- in patch mode -- with
   the contours that are already on the image. Existing contours always win: a patching run
   adds, it never removes.
5. **Write.** Ordinary contours, `added_by` naming the model, unreviewed, so they land in the
   review queue like any other annotation.

Everything here is synchronous: it runs inside a Celery worker, not inside the event loop.
The AI-service clients are async (they are shared with the interactive routes), so the two
calls that need them are bridged with `asyncio.run` -- once per unit, which is noise next to
a forward pass.
