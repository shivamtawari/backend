# This must NOT be Celery's default "celery" queue. The backend and the ai-service are two
# separate Celery apps sharing one Redis broker, and the ai-service worker consumes the
# default queue as a fallback alongside its own ai.training. Publishing here on the default
# queue makes it a race: if the ai-service worker picks the message up first it does not have
# these tasks registered, so it logs "Received unregistered task of type 'inference.run_next'"
# and *discards* it. Nothing retries, so the run stops dead with its job row still saying
# running -- which then also blocks every future run on that dataset.
#
# A dedicated queue removes the race entirely: the ai-service worker never sees these
# messages, whatever it is subscribed to.
# Local worktrees can share one Redis broker. Let each launcher select a private queue so a
# worker from another checkout cannot consume a job id and look for it in the wrong database.
