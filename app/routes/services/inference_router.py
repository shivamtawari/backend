"""Batch inference: annotate a whole dataset with a hand-picked orchestration of models.

The counterpart to the annotation canvas, where a model runs on the one image in front of
you. Here a user binds each label to a model, picks how the predictions meet the annotations
that already exist (patch or replace), and hands the whole dataset to Celery.

Everything is gated on `AI_BATCH_INFER`. Starting a *replace* run additionally needs
`MASK_DELETE`: it deletes existing contours and their child objects before predicting, which
is a destructive act on annotations, not an AI capability -- and `confirm_replace` must be
set explicitly, so no default-valued field can ever trigger one.
