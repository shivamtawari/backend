"""Regression tests for the COCO export's use of native image dimensions.

Background: contours are stored with normalized [0, 1] coordinates, and the COCO
export materializes pixel-space geometry by scaling them by the image size. A bug at
ingest stored *thumbnail* dimensions (<=200px) in ``Images.width/height`` because
``PIL.Image.thumbnail`` mutates in place, so exports came out ~20x too small.

These tests pin two guarantees:
  1. ``save_image_to_disk`` reports the native (full-resolution) size, not the
     thumbnail size.
  2. ``build_coco_payload`` always emits native ``images[].width/height`` (read from
     the real file on disk, even when the DB columns are stale) and every annotation's
     bbox fits within those native bounds, with area recomputed in native space.
